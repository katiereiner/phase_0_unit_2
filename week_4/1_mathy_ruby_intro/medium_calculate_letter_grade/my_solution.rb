# U2.W4: Calculate a letter grade!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode 
=begin 
count = 0
sum = 0
for i in my array
	sum = i
	count ++,
	end
	puts sum/count
=end

# What is the input? input is number grades 
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?) 
#output is letter grade
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?


# 2. Initial Solution
def avg(my_array)
	var="sum"
	sum = 0
	for i in my_array
		sum += i 
	end
		puts sum/my_array.length
end
avg([88,96,54,67,86,35,98,100])
